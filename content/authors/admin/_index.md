# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interests focus on "reasoning over safety", or RoS, which lies at the intersection of causal discovery and representation, skill-based abstraction and safe reinforcement learning. Specifically, I'm interested in their applications in safety-critical scenarios like autonomous vehicles and robot manipulation. 

interests:
- Causal Representation Learning
- Trustworthy Reinforcement Learning
- Contact-rich Manipulation and Robotic Assembly

I am a third year PhD student of {{< staticref "https://safeai-lab.github.io/" "newtab" >}}SafeAI Lab{{< /staticref >}} at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Professor {{< staticref "https://safeai-lab.github.io/people.html" "newtab" >}}Ding Zhao{{< /staticref >}}. I also work closely with Professor {{< staticref "https://aisecure.github.io/" "newtab" >}}Bo Li{{< /staticref >}}. My current research interest lies at the intersection of causal representation learning and generalizable reinforcement learning, which can potentially be applied on robots and other autonomous systems. Prior to CMU, I spent wonderful time collaborating with {{< staticref "https://shj1987.github.io/" "newtab" >}}Huajie Shao{{< /staticref >}}, who joined William and Mary as tenure-track assistant professor.

<!-- I was admitted to the CSST research program this summer at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which has been unfortunately suspended due to the outbreak of COVID-19.

I take an active part in Mathematical Modeling Competition. I received Finalist Prize (2% among 20,000+ teams) this year in Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM). -->

<!-- I am applying for a Ph.D./MS program this fall. You may check in my {{< staticref "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eolZzPNGJS-zb31B2uaAC3GMhQCTY-Pv/view?usp=sharing" "newtab" >}}CV{{< /staticref >}} for further information. -->
