I am a senior undergraduate student at the Dept. of Control Science & Engineering, Zhejiang University. I've been advised by professor Li Guang at ZJU BME Lab, where I focus on extracting features fro biological time series with deep neural networks. I further extend my work in the field of disentangled representation learning during my remote intern with Ph.D. Shao Huajie from CS@UIUC. Now I'm working on a NIPS challenge related to autonomous driving with both time series analysis and representation learning.

I was admitted to the CSST research program this summer at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which has been unfortunately suspended due to the outbreak of COVID-19.

I take an active part in Mathematical Modeling Competition. I received Finalist Prize (2% among 20,000+ teams) this year in Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM).

I am applying for a Ph.D./MS program this fall. You may check in my {{< staticref "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eolZzPNGJS-zb31B2uaAC3GMhQCTY-Pv/view?usp=sharing" "newtab" >}}CV{{< /staticref >}} for further information.
