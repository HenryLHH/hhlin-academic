I am a senior undergraduate student at the Dept. of Control Science & Engineering, Zhejiang University. Since I was enrolled in Robotics track in my Sophomore year, I've been working on some related research topics in AI & Robotics. I've working at ZJU BME Lab, advised by professor Li Guang. I further extend my work in field of representation learning during my remote intern with Ph.D. Shao Huajie from CS@UIUC. Now I am working on an interesting workshop related to autonomous driving with both time series analysis and representation learning.

I was admitted to the CSST research program this summer at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which has been unfortunately suspended due to the outbreak of COVID-19.

I take an active part in Mathematical Modeling Competition. I received Finalist Prize (2% among 20,000+ teams) this year in Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM).

I am applying for a a Ph.D./MS program this fall.
