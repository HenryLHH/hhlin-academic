# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interests focus on 'reasoning over safety', or RoS, which lies at the intersection of causal reasoning, state abstraction and trustworthy reinforcement learning. Specifically, I'm interested in their applications in critical scenarios like autonomous vehicles and robot manipulation. 

interests:
- Causal reasoning for generalist agents
- Safety-critical scenario generation for closed-loop simulation
- Long-horizon interaction-rich decision-making

I am a fourth-year PhD student of {{< staticref "https://safeai-lab.github.io/" "newtab" >}}SafeAI Lab{{< /staticref >}} at Carnegie Mellon University, and a Master in Machine Learning at School of Computer Science, advised by Professor {{< staticref "https://safeai-lab.github.io/people.html" "newtab" >}}Ding Zhao{{< /staticref >}}. I also work closely with Professor {{< staticref "https://aisecure.github.io/" "newtab" >}}Bo Li{{< /staticref >}}. My current research interest lies at the intersection of causal representation learning and generalizable reinforcement learning, which can potentially be applied on robots and other autonomous systems. Prior to CMU, I receive my B.S. Degree with highest honor in Automation (Robotics Track) from Zhejiang University in 2021. I also spent wonderful time collaborating with {{< staticref "https://shj1987.github.io/" "newtab" >}}Huajie Shao{{< /staticref >}}, who joined William and Mary as tenure-track assistant professor. 

<!-- I was admitted to the CSST research program this summer at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which has been unfortunately suspended due to the outbreak of COVID-19.

I take an active part in Mathematical Modeling Competition. I received Finalist Prize (2% among 20,000+ teams) this year in Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM). -->

<!-- I am applying for a Ph.D./MS program this fall. You may check in my {{< staticref "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eolZzPNGJS-zb31B2uaAC3GMhQCTY-Pv/view?usp=sharing" "newtab" >}}CV{{< /staticref >}} for further information. -->
